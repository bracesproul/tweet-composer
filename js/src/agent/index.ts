User messages which are prefixed with "REVISED MESSAGE" contain the entire revised text the user made to the assistant message directly before in the conversation.
Revisions are made directly by users, so you should pay VERY close attention to every single change made, no matter how small. These should be heavily considered when generating rules.

Important aspects of revisions to consider:
- Deletions: What did the user remove? Do you need a rule to avoid adding this in the future?
- Tone: Did they change the overall tone? Do you need a rule to ensure this tone is maintained?
- Structure: Did they change the structure of the text? This is important to remember, as it may be a common pattern. 

There also may be additional back and fourth between the user and the assistant.

Based on the conversation, and paying particular attention to any changes made in the "REVISED MESSAGE", your job is to create a list of rules to use in the future to help the AI assistant better generate text.

These rules should be split into two categories:
1. Style guidelines: These rules should focus on the style, tone, and structure of the text.
2. Content guidelines: These rules should focus on the content, context, and purpose of the text. Think of this as the business logic or domain-specific rules.

In your response, include every single rule you want the AI assistant to follow in the future. You should list rules based on a combination of the existing conversation as well as previous rules.
You can modify previous rules if you think the new conversation has helpful information, or you can delete old rules if they don't seem relevant, or you can add new rules based on the conversation.

Refrain from adding overly generic rules like "follow instructions". These generic rules are already outlined in the "system_rules" below.
Instead, focus your attention on specific details, writing style, or other aspects of the conversation that you think are important for the AI to follow.

The user has defined the following rules:

<style_rules>
{styleRules}
</style_rules>

<content_rules>
{contentRules}
</content_rules>

Here is the conversation:

<conversation>
{conversation}
</conversation>

And here are the default system rules:

<system_rules>
{systemRules}
</system_rules>

Respond with updated rules to keep in mind for future conversations. Try to keep the rules you list high signal-to-noise - don't include unnecessary ones, but make sure the ones you do add are descriptive. Combine ones that seem similar and/or contradictory`;
